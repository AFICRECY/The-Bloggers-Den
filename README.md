## Description:
https://git.heroku.com/the-bloggers-den.git

Developers spend a considerable amount of time creating new applications and debugging existing codebases. They also devote some of their time to reading and writing about technical concepts, recent advancements, and new technologies. Writing about technology is equally crucial as building it. Technology blogs offer more than just the latest news about technology. They provide us with comprehensive analyses of the products that are available in the market today. As a result, we become more informed consumers who can make better choices. By reading product reviews, we can gain a thorough understanding of a particular product's pros and cons. It is important to seek out tech blogs that are impartial in their opinions and not focused on promoting or marketing specific products.

This application brings together many different kinds of software and associated packages to create a dynamic and user-friendly Tech Blog Website called “The Blogger’s Den”. The Blogger’s Den is an application which gives users an opportunity to create, read, update, and delete their personalized accounts that hold their own blog post as well as other users posts. In addition, users are able to click into another user's blog post, and leave reviews.

### Installation:

To install this project, a knowledge of JavaScript, Node.js, and Express.js, SQL, Sequelize, Handlebars, and Heroku  were required. I installed the following dependencies with my npm install (bcrypt, dotenv, express-handlebars, mysql2, and sequelize). I had to first install Node.js to my computer and then install the Express and NPM packages. The Express package allowed me to use the express framework in Node.js. Softwares that were new to me were bcrypt, which I used for password hashing, and express-handlebars that uses a template and an input object to generate HTML. A handlebars expression is a {{, some contents, followed by a }}. When the template is executed, these expressions are replaced with values from an input object. In order to create this application, HTML, CSS, Server Side JavaScript, SQL, and Sequelize, and Handlebars all needed to be used in order to allow users to store their own personalized data onto the Sequelize models that I built. Methods used ranged from, Template Literals, Arrow Functions, Objects, and Functions, Variables, If/Else Statements, and the server side JavaScript. The web application is intended for the user to be able to create an account and login to the website. They are given the opportunity to create, read, update, or delete any of the Tech Blog content that they input to their Dashboard. Once they have created a post, it is automatically placed onto the user’s homepage. Here they will have the opportunity to see other users’ blog posts as well as leave comments . The code below makes this happen.
